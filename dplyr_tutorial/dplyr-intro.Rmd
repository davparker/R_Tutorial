tutorial from R Bloggers

```{r}
# library(plyr)
# detach(package:plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(hflights)
data(hflights)
head(hflights)
```

* `tbl_df` creates a local data frame
* This is a wrapper for data frame, prevents accidental printing

```{r}
flights <- tbl_df(hflights)

# samply table data frame prnting
flights

print(flights, n=20)
data.frame(head(flights))
# or
head(hflights)
```

## verb 1: filter

First, base R approach
```{r}
flights[flights$Month == 1 & flights$DayofMonth == 1, ]
```

Dplyr filter

```{r}
#comma defaults to &
filter(flights, Month == 1 & DayofMonth == 1)
# use | for or
filter(flights, UniqueCarrier == "AA" | UniqueCarrier == "UA")
# %in% works as well
filter(flights, UniqueCarrier %in% c("AA", "UA") )

```
